Background 
Your divisional manager has just returned from a motivational speech given to senior management by the newly appointed CEO. In her speech the CEO advocated for “excellence”, “agility”, “transformation”, and she particularly emphasised the need to foster “intrapreneurship” in the organisation. This is an extract from her speech.
Fostering intrapreneurship, where employees act as entrepreneurs within the organization, brings numerous benefits. It drives innovation by encouraging team members to generate and develop fresh ideas that can lead to new products, services, or improvements in existing processes. This innovative approach can help companies stay competitive and adapt to market changes quickly. 
Intrapreneurship also boosts employee engagement and satisfaction. When employees are empowered to take ownership of projects and see the tangible impact of their work, they feel more valued and connected to the company’s mission. This often leads to higher retention rates and can attract top talent seeking workplaces that encourage creativity and growth. 
Additionally, intrapreneurial initiatives can create new revenue streams or improve cost efficiencies. By leveraging existing resources and knowledge within the company, intrapreneurs can pursue projects with reduced risk compared to external entrepreneurial ventures. The organization can thus innovate cost-effectively and maintain a steady growth trajectory.

This adaptability is especially valuable in volatile markets, where companies that can pivot quickly gain a strategic advantage. In summary, promoting intrapreneurship not only accelerates innovation but also strengthens employee morale, enhances operational efficiency, and builds a more resilient, forward-thinking organization. 
Your divisional manager is somewhat sceptical about some of these claims and is not even really sure what “intrapreneurship” is. He has asked you to quickly search for and critically appraise the best relevant scientific evidence.
